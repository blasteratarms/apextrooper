# apextrooper
The Apextrooper is the culmination of efforts in converting an Alphatrooper to a 200+ fps half dart slam fire blaster.
Definitely a hat tip to blasterbros thatboyjacob for the idea to switch it to top prime.

Assembled image of the internals to show how extensive of a mod this is.

3/8 brass for the pusher
1-1/2in drain tailpipe for the cylinder
1/4-20 flathead screw 1.5 to 2in long for connecting the plunger head to the shaft also acts as reinforcement for the amount of spring flex.
5/16 allthread for a priming rod
a few m3 screws and hex nuts for the barrel clamp and the pivot for the mag catch.
F12-21m Thrust bearing helps smoothout the prime but isn't necessary.
